# Layout Manager
My aim is to provide three basic user interfaces and two drop boxes facilitating the selection of the options. THis project was built for smartphones running on Android 9 or above.
## Motivation behind the project
I wanted an interactive layout which provides input modules for the user to enter their details and select an option from the dropbox (in Android world it is called Spinner) and see their details in print form. This app is my first using Android Studio, so this app is like the entire learning curve for me in Android Studio and I have used Java as the programming language. 
## Features
This app provides an interactive layout where the user can enter their details and it displays the entered details on a pop up page. 
## Features that will be added
I am planning to add a few features in the upcoming updates which include: 
1) Adding database support where the data that the user enters will be stored locally in the device (probably SQL Lite will be the solution)
2) Adding a “Change Theme” button where the user can change the layout of the app. It changes according to the pre-set layouts defined in the app layout
3) Dark mode support 
## How to Use
Launching this app is very simple. Cold boot the emulator and once the device is up and running, then launch the app. Enter the details in the box given and then click the submit button. The entered details will appear on another page 

**NOTE: This app does not store any value that the user enters, not even in the local storage**
